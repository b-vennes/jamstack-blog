A rundown of software development tools, libraries, and languages that I love working with in 2020.

## 10. Angular

My go-to client-side framework.

The options for front-end frameworks are plentiful, but the three most popular are React, Vue, and Angular (also see Svelte and Elm).

For several reasons around scalability, Angular has been a common choice for large companies. However, popularity has been slowly declining over the last couple of years as React has gained more [mindshare](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&date=today%205-y&q=Vue.js,React,Angular).

That being said, I think Angular is an excellent option for small-scale projects too. There is lots of documenation online and the Angular has an excellent [tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial). The biggest hurdle with Angular is its steep learning curve.

My favorite parts of Angular are the number of out-of-the-box components, support for observables with RxJs, and its phenomenal command-line utility `ng`.

## 9. Pop_OS!

A beginner friendly Linux distribution.

I've been working with Pop_OS! for 3 years and I can't imagine using any other distro anytime soon. The OS itself is a downstream branch of Ubuntu, so it will be familiar to users coming from a Debian-like ecosystem. The user interface uses Gnome instead of Unity. I highly recommend installing Gnome Tweaks and configuring things as you'd like.

Version 20.04 shipped out of the box with a workspace management system, which auto aligns windows for you as you open them. I'm impressed with the number of features the team at System76 is able to pack into each release.

Overall, Pop is an excellent beginner-friendly Linux OS that ships with a lot of great tools right out of the box. Fans of Unix, Windows, and Mac-OS systems will all find a home here.

## 8. Jekyll

A simple framework for building web apps with markdown content.

Due to issues with discoverability and SEO performance with my Angular-built blog, I needed to switch to a non-SPA system.

A co-worker recommended Jekyll and I was quickly impressed after trying out a tutorial. It comes with an elegant out-of-the-box theme that requires no tweaks to get running. The documentation is pretty solid and its also very configurable. I was even able to create my own theme from the ground up using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/).

It's important to note that some Ruby knowledge would be helpful going in, but it is not required by any means.

Time will tell how well it handles SEO-optimizations, but since the Markdown+HTML+SASS+JS all gets compiled to plain HTML+CSS+JS, I have no fears about discoverability.

## 7. Rocket

An elegant and well-documented Rust server framework.

Quick Disclaimer: Rocket currently requires the nightly version of Rust to build and has no async/futures support as of now. Support for async and stable Rust are planned for sometime soon, but for now, it should not be used in production. See [AWWY](http://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/frameworks/) for alternative web server frameworks for Rust.

Rocket is the most fun web server I've ever used. It has built-in support for lots of different things you might want to use a web framework for. And the best part is that it doesn't require any hacky workarounds to be useful. Everything feels natural to the Rust ecosystem and Rust's compiler safety is preserved.

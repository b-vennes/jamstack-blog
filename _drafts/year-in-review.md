When I graduated from university in Spring 2019 I couldn't wait to get into the software industry and start getting my hands on real software projects.  There were so many things I wanted to learn and I wanted to learn them all as soon as I could. I was overconfident for certain, but I also know there was a lot I didn't know.  These are a few of the things I've learned in the last year working on two different teams with two very different dynamics, processes, and roles.

### Take Time In Learning A New Skill

When I moved to the development team, I started learning about and consuming asmuch information on web development as I coud.  I was watching every tutorial and guide on Angular and ASP.NET that I could get my hands on.  I was learning lots of new technologies at a rapid pace. With so much new knowledge at my disposal, I began to view myself as a master developer and developed a big ego.

But despite feeling confident in my skills, I really was not proficient in the technologies yet.  I had fallen into the trap of not knowing what I don't know.

I did a little research on this topic and it is called the [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect.

I could probably write a whole post about what this effect is an how I've experienced it as a developer and in other places, and perhaps I will. The quick overview is that along our journey towards mastery in a field, we quickly become overconfident in our own abilities. Here's how wikipedia describes it:

> In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is.
> It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability.
> Without the self-awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.

I discovered this bias when I tried to push the limits of what I knew how to do, and failed miserably.  I would try to build simple applications with what I had learned from the tutorials and find myself constantly hitting barriers I couldn't overcome without help from the internet.

As a developer, it can be easy to feel like I can do better than my current job or company.  That I should be moving on to bigger and better things as quickly as I can.  But I've realized that this thinking is just another instance of the Dunning-Krueger Effect.  For this next year especially, I want to focus less on striving to find an open position at Nintendo and Google, and more on helping develop better software at my current company.

### Confusing Code Isn't Always Bad

On multple cases while working as both an SDET and developer I would run across code that baffled me.  I would think, "Whomever wrote this code clearly has no idea what they are doing, let me scrap everything and redo it".  Then, after spending hours rethinking and reworking the code, I would nearly always end up with a component that is more complex and confusing than it was before I mangled it.

Now, I do think that we should strive for classes and components that are simple and can be understood by our teammates.  But I do not think that writing immediately understandable code will always lead to good results.  If a particular problem requires a complex solution, we should not try to wrap it in a simple one that is easy to understand.  However, I think a solution  can be documented so that any future readers (which often can includes the original author) can understand its intent.  The best way to do this is through method headers on class interfaces.  Inline comments are helpful to a point, but they can also make a codebase messy.  Since method headers often follow a strict pattern, the codebase can retain its elegance.

When reading a new piece of code, I'll try to focus more on the constraints and environment that the original author was working in, instead of assuming anything negative.  More often than not, complicated classes are trying to tackle complicated problems.  Incremental changes instead of overhauls are almost always what is necessary in these circumstances.

### Learn And Accept Mistakes

Software fails.  With much pain to my ego, I must admit that multiple projects I've worked on over the last year have failed, and in a few cases, failed miserably.  When we work on something that crashes and burns on first contact with an unexpected behavior or environment, it can seem like we as humans have failed in some way.  Like there is some problem with ourselves that has manifested itself into the code we write.

This, of course, is not true at all.  Projects can fail for a huge number of reasons, and I'm yet to see a project that has failed because of one person's mistake.  It is an assortment of mistakes and missteps that can lead to a doomed project.

### Take Time To Learn New Things

Software has begun to take over my life in several ways.  Not only has it become my career, but it has also become one of my favorite hobbies.  I balance my free time and weekends between spending time with my wife and two dogs, exercising, playing videogames, doing chores, and *learning more about computer programming*.

Development has slowly begun to take over my thought processes and daydreams.  While falling asleep I'll be thinking about how I to solve a problem I've run into on my latest project, or while taking a shower I'll be thinking of faster methods for pipelining data.  There is a near infinite expanse of knowledge in the realm of development, and I've found that my brain is fueled by a drive to learn concepts, patterns, and technologies that I've never seen before.

It is both exciting and dispiriting to know that I'll never be able to learn everything there is to know about computers and development.  I've discovered too, that when I let my mind traverse the realm of computer science unrestricted, I quickly encounter a depressing burnout afterwards.  When my brain needs a week or two long break to not think about too much.

In 2018, I worked 160 hours in the span of two weeks splitting time between my internship and a game jam that I volunteered myself for.  My brain was running on adrenaline and overdrive.  Every hour I was awake was spent thinking about my game.  When it was over, I was very proud of what I had built, but I was mentally and physically drained.

I don't think I'll ever want to push myself so hard again.  Even though I learned a lot and accomplished something great, it definitely was not a sustainable behavior. I've been trying to manage my self-taught learning with that project in mind.  Although anything I work on could really teach me a lot, I have to remember to balance my hobbies with my relationships and my responsibilities.  In 2020 I am really hoping to move closer to an equilibrium between all the important facets of my life.

### Build Relationships With Coworkers

The people you work with will be the ones who will expand your horizons to new oppurtunities. They are the ones who will speak up for you if you need it, recommend you to new jobs, and get you in contact with peopke who could take your career to new places.

Beyond career development, the people you work with will give you new perspectives on all aspects of your life. Although the software development community tends to be dominated by the same type of person, white males with a wealthy upbringing, everyone has their own unique experiences. Their perspective on the world can help you improve your own. They can push you to rethink ideologies that you would otherwise have set in stone. Being around others that are different than you can mold you into a better person than you would otherwise be by staying closed off.

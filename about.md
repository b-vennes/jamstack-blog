Hi there! My name is Branden Vennes and I am a full-stack software developer at a midsize software company in Portland, Oregon.

I put this blog together to help me reflect on new skills and technologies I come across. I also hope to give reviews of books, chat about something I find interesting, or throw my opinion into the web.

Although I spend most of my time working in C# and TypeScript, I love tinkering with interesting programming languages, frameworks, and techs.

I'm also an avid follower of Formula 1 racing and love playing videogames when I get the chance to relax.

Thanks for stopping by and check back soon for more articles!
